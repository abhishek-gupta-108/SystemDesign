# SystemDesign



As an Engineer you should know the following concepts

Idempotency → Prevents duplicate payments
Pagination → Keeps your DB from dying
Versioning → Lets you evolve APIs without breaking clients
Rate limiting → Protects your service from abuse
Error codes → Helps clients handle failures correctly
Caching → Reduces load by 90%
JWT security → Prevents leaking sensitive data
N+1 queries → The difference between 10ms and 10s response time
Docs → Stops the `how does this API work?` Slack messages
Consistency → Choose the right tradeoff for your use case
Observability → You can’t fix what you can’t see.
Logs, metrics, traces save more production incidents than code.
