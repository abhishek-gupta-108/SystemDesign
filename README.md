# SystemDesign



As an Engineer you should know the following concepts

1. Idempotency → Prevents duplicate payments
2. Pagination → Keeps your DB from dying
3. Versioning → Lets you evolve APIs without breaking clients
4. Rate limiting → Protects your service from abuse
5. Error codes → Helps clients handle failures correctly
6. Caching → Reduces load by 90%
7. JWT security → Prevents leaking sensitive data
8. N+1 queries → The difference between 10ms and 10s response time
9. Docs → Stops the `how does this API work?` Slack messages
10. Consistency → Choose the right tradeoff for your use case
11. Observability → You can’t fix what you can’t see.
12. Logs, metrics, traces save more production incidents than code.
