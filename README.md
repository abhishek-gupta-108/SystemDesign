[API Architecture](https://github.com/abhishek-gupta-108/SystemDesign/blob/main/APIArchitecture.md)


## DATABASES

As an Engineer you should know the following concepts



## To Learn
1. Idempotency → Prevents duplicate payments
2. Pagination → Keeps your DB from dying
3. Versioning → Lets you evolve APIs without breaking clients
4. Rate limiting → Protects your service from abuse
5. Error codes → Helps clients handle failures correctly
6. Caching → Reduces load by 90%
7. JWT security → Prevents leaking sensitive data
8. N+1 queries → The difference between 10ms and 10s response time
9. Docs → Stops the `how does this API work?` Slack messages
10. Consistency → Choose the right tradeoff for your use case
11. Observability → You can’t fix what you can’t see.
12. Logs, metrics, traces save more production incidents than code.


Back to the topics: 
1. Networking basics
 ↣ IP addressing
 ↣ Domain Name System (DNS)
 ↣ Client server model
 ↣ HTTP request response lifecycle
 ↣ TLS and HTTPS

2. Transport and streaming
 ↣ TCP
 ↣ UDP
 ↣ WebSockets
 ↣ HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
 ↣ Long polling and Server Sent Events

3. Cloud and infrastructure
 ↣ Cloud computing models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
 ↣ Regions and availability zones
 ↣ Virtual machines and containers
 ↣ Kubernetes and orchestration basics
 ↣ Service discovery

4. Traffic management layer
 ↣ Load balancers (L4 and L7)
 ↣ Forward proxy
 ↣ Reverse proxy
 ↣ API gateway
 ↣ Rate limiting

5. Data storage fundamentals
 ↣ Relational databases
 ↣ NoSQL families (key value, document, column, graph)
 ↣ SQL vs NoSQL trade offs
 ↣ Indexing strategies
 ↣ Transactions and isolation levels

6. Distributed data patterns
 ↣ Replication
 ↣ Sharding and partitioning
 ↣ Consistency models (strong, eventual)
 ↣ Leader follower architecture
 ↣ CAP theorem

7. Caching and performance
 ↣ Cache basics, hits and misses
 ↣ Cache eviction policies
 ↣ Cache aside pattern
 ↣ Read through and write through
 ↣ Content Delivery Network (CDN)

8. Messaging and async workflows
 ↣ Message queues
 ↣ Publish subscribe
 ↣ Event driven architecture
 ↣ Idempotency
 ↣ Delivery semantics (at least once, at most once, exactly once)

9. Storage and media handling
 ↣ Object storage
 ↣ Block vs file storage
 ↣ Data compression
 ↣ Encoding and transcoding
 ↣ Tiered storage and lifecycle policies

10. Reliability and observability
 ↣ High availability and nines
 ↣ Fault tolerance and redundancy
 ↣ Health checks and circuit breakers
 ↣ Logging and log aggregation
 ↣ Metrics, monitoring and alerting
